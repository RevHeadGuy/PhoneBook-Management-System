# PhoneBook-Management-System

The Phone Book Management System is a data structure-based application that efficiently stores and manages contact information using a doubly linked list. This system allows users to add, delete, update, and search contacts dynamically. Unlike arrays, the doubly linked list provides flexible memory management, enabling easy insertion and deletion of nodes from any position in the list without shifting other elements. Each contact is represented as a node containing details like name, phone number, and email address, with links to both the previous and next nodes, enhancing traversal in both directions. This approach ensures efficient management and manipulation of contact data, making the system adaptable and scalable.
The use of a doubly linked list in the Phone Book Management System offers significant advantages, especially in terms of time complexity for operations. Unlike traditional data structures such as arrays, where resizing or rearranging elements can be cumbersome, a doubly linked list allows quick adjustments without reallocation of the entire structure. This feature is particularly useful for managing a phone book, where contacts may need frequent updates or reordering. The bidirectional traversal capabilities of the doubly linked list make it easier to navigate through the contacts, whether searching from the beginning or the end of the list. Furthermore, this structure supports efficient memory utilization as it only allocates space when new contacts are added, minimizing waste. Overall, the system provides a robust and flexible way to manage personal or organizational contact information, making it a suitable choice for applications requiring dynamic data handling.
